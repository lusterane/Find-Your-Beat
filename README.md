# Find Your Beat
Personal Project
## What is it?
Find Your Beat helps people find new music based on their own preferences. There is also a "Taste Breaker" option that randomizes the search for a new genre or song if you are feeling adventerous.

## How Does it Work?
Find Your Beat indexes through the /r/Music subreddit to find new music in accordance to the user's taste preferences. There are many other options provided to support a more flexible user experience including deeper search for more music results and a randomizer that helps explore new genres and music.
