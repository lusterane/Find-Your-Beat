# Find Your Beat
Personal Project
## What is it?
Find Your Beat helps people find new music based on their own preferences. There is also a "Taste Breaker" option that randomizes the search for a new genre or song if you are feeling adventerous.

## How Does it Work?
Find Your Beat indexes through the /r/Music subreddit to find new music in accordance to the user's taste preferences.

## Features
* Finds music based on specified preferences
* Taste Breaker option to find music outside of search preferences
* Fluid UI through terminal
* Automatic indexing through as many pages as user likes to (tested 500+)
* Setup for modularity supporting other websites

## To implement in future
* Creation of executable for program
* Full support of scraping other websites
* Graphical User Interface

### Bugs to fix
* Minor formatting nuances
* Error handeling for some inputs
